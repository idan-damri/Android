# Android
Here I'll publish android apps I developed.

There'll be apps that I developed using the help and guidness given by the Udacity android development for beginners course.
The source code of those apps was written by me, and is not copied.
The only difference between the original applications that I will publish to the applications I developed with the Udacity course is the guidance and tips that the lecturers give in the course, which I find valuable.
